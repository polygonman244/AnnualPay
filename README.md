# AnnualPay
# Calculates annual pay for an occupation.
# This is an assignment from school that I'm interested in improving on.
# I want to be able to add more features, such as:
    # 1. Calculate gross pay, net pay, and be able to account for state taxes and expenses.
    # 2. Add place of employment.
    # 3. Add custom GUI, powershell/CLI integration.
# Just thought it would be cool to mess around with :)
# Edit: The obj and bin folders belong in /AnnualPay folder.
    # bin and obj folders somehow didnt go through on the initial commit
